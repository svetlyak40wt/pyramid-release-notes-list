This list contains direct links to pyromid's CHANGES.txt for different branches.
We need this to keep tracking the project at [AllMyChanges.com](https://allmychanges.com)
because it need a single place where to start crawling.

The reason why this list exists â€“ Pyramid's maintainers don't want to keep a full
changelog in their 'master' branch.
